# Protocols

A collection of practical setup and configuration protocols, born from real-world experience and documented step-by-step so they're reproducible.

## Available Protocols

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Claude Code Sandbox Setup (WSL2)](protocols/sandbox-setup-protocol.md) | Setting up sandboxed Claude Code on Windows with WSL2, bubblewrap, network restrictions, and permission hardening |

## About

These protocols reflect my personal experience. Tested workflows that I've documented for my own reference and for anyone who finds them useful. They're opinionated, specific, and aimed at getting things working rather than covering every possible scenario.

Each protocol includes disclaimers where relevant. Always cross-reference with official documentation.
